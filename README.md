Web-based project using JS programming (jQuery, Node.js, JSON)

This project is currently in development within our cloud computing studies.
The objective is to have a basic webchat adding new functionalities step by step.

Using node.js working with the socket.io lib, weÂ´d like to run our application on a server to establish a cloud-based service.
